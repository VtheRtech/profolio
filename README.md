Hypothesis: CCP implemented victory point gain mechanic such that each faction gains points even in the absence of systems being held.

Results:Amarrmil seem to be gaining approximately 36.8 thousand points per hour, while Minmil gain approximately 25.0 thousand points per hour.

Conclusion:
Hacking sites in the amarrmil wz and handing in research stuff probably does almost nothing relative to the contribution that system contestion plays in achieving victory in the current event.


things i learned a quick summmary.
1. Assuming no change in system ownership (unlikely tbh), Amarrmil and Minmil will achieve their victory threshold in 8 and 29 days, respectively.

2. CCP may have added a baseline rate of victory point gain for amarrmil and minmil (independent of how many systems are held).

3. Passive victory point gain for each faction is estimated to be approximately 12,000 * (n+1) points per hour, where n is the number of systems currently being held by the faction.

Hypothesis: the davince surgical device will improve patent care outcome in the hospital enviroment and improve vistations.

Results: visitations where up the first few months after installing the device, However those numbers should not be be expected to stay the same as extrenal studies indicate that a drop of revenue back to the first year is typcially what follows. 

things i learned a quick summmary: a hospitals community may get curious when new surgical technology is introduced which may result in increased vistations to that hosptial but it falls off if patent care outcomes do not change.

Hypothesis: daily usage numbers are higher among member than they are among casual members.

Result: Hypothesis was proven correct! usage certinaly is higher among members who are members! however casual users are often going longer distances!
