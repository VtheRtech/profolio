Hypothesis: CCP implemented a victory point gain mechanic such that each faction gains points without systems being held.

Results: Amarrmil seems to be gaining approximately 36.8 thousand points per hour, while Minmil gains approximately 25.0 thousand points per hour.

Conclusion:
Hacking sites in the amarrmil wz and handing in research probably does almost nothing relative to the contribution that system contestion plays in achieving victory in the current event.


Insights Gained from this analysis:
1. Assuming no change in system ownership, Amarrmil and Minmil will achieve their victory threshold in 8 and 29 days, respectively.

2. CCP may have added a baseline rate of victory point gain for amarrmil and minmil (independent of how many systems are held).

3. Passive victory point gain for each faction is estimated to be approximately 12,000 * (n+1) points per hour, where n is the number of systems currently being held by the faction.

Hypothesis: the advanced surgical device will improve patient care outcomes in the hospital environment and improve visits.

Results: visitations were up the first few months after installing the device; however, those numbers should be different as external studies indicate that a drop in revenue back to the first year is typically what follows. 

Insights Gained from this analysis: a hospital's community may get curious when new surgical technology is introduced, which may result in increased visits to that hospital, but it falls off if patient care outcomes stay the same.
