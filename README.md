Hypothesis: CCP implemented victory point gain mechanic such that each faction gains points even in the absence of systems being held.

Results:Amarrmil seem to be gaining approximately 36.8 thousand points per hour, while Minmil gain approximately 25.0 thousand points per hour.

Conclusion:
Hacking sites in the amarrmil wz and handing in research stuff probably does almost nothing relative to the contribution that system contestion plays in achieving victory in the current event.

1. Assuming no change in system ownership (unlikely tbh), Amarrmil and Minmil will achieve their victory threshold in 8 and 29 days, respectively.

2. CCP may have added a baseline rate of victory point gain for amarrmil and minmil (independent of how many systems are held).

3. Passive victory point gain for each faction is estimated to be approximately 12,000 * (n+1) points per hour, where n is the number of systems currently being held by the faction.
